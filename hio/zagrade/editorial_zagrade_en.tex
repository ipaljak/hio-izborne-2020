\textsf{Necessary skills: stack, parentheses, ad hoc}

We first describe the solution for the case when the whole password is a valid
sequence. In the first subtask we have $Q = \frac{N^2}{4}$, so we can query
every even lenght interval (note that it makes no sense to query odd lenght
intervals). One possible solution is the following: we ask for the first two
charactes, first four, and so on unitl we get a positive answer. We then know
the position of the close parenthesis which is paired up with the open
parenthesis on the first position. Now we can recursively solve the same task
for the interval between these parentheses, and for the interval that is on the
right of the close parenthesis.

In the third subtask, we can ask $Q = N - 1$ queries. We will use a stack, which
is empty at the beginning. We traverse the positions in order. If the stack is
empty, push the current position on the stack. Otherwise, ask the query for the
interval between the position on top and the current position. If the answer is
positive, those parentheses are paired up (left is open and right
is close), and we pop the stack. If the answer
is negative, we push the current position on the stack. In the end, the stack
will be empty.

What if the whole password is not a valid sequence? The algorithm is the same,
but the stack doesn't have to be empty in the end. First half of
the remaining postions must have a close parenthesis, and the second half an
open parenthesis.
